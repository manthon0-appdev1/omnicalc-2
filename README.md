## Target

The username and password is on Canvas — here is our target:

[https://omnicalc-2.matchthetarget.com/](https://omnicalc-2.matchthetarget.com/)

## Query strings

The essential concept: visitors can add a **query string** onto _any_ URL in your Rails app, e.g.

```
/rock?dessert=Ice cream&color=Orange
```

Watch what happens in your server log when you visit that URL.

Rails parses any query string parameters and puts them into a special Hash called `params`. You have access to `params` in the action.

With that simple fact, combined with the way that HTML forms behave when submitted, we can invent ways to make any forms we want work!

## Your first task

Wire up the following 4 RCAVs and add `<h1>` elements to each that say "Addition", "Subtraction", "Multiplication", and "Division":

 - `/add`
 - `/subtract`
 - `/multiply`
 - `/divide`

Use the [slides](https://slides.com/raghubetina/07-routing?token=Qj5aA5z3), [chapter](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/779), and your RPS RCAV workspace as a reference.

## Your second task

Visit your `/wizard_add` URL, but type a query string on to the end: `?first_num=3&second_num=4`. So, the whole path should be:

```
/wizard_add?first_num=3&second_num=4
```

First pull up the Terminal tab running your server and Cmd-K or Ctrl-K to clear it out, then visit that URL again. Scroll to the top of the Terminal tab. Read the log — what do you notice?

The `params` Parameters `Hash`! Use the `params` hash in the action you defined to calculate a result and display it in the view template you created. Make the markup [match the target](https://omnicalc-2.matchthetarget.com/wizard_add?first_num=3&second_num=4).

## Do the other 3

Do the same thing for 

 - `/wizard_subtract`,
 - `/wizard_multiply`,
 - and `/wizard_divide`.

## Add forms

Now, make it easier on your users. They should not have to type into the address bar of their browsers to access these useful calculations.

Can you invent a way to make it easier for them using what you've learned about RCAV, `params`, and what we reverse-engineered about how HTML forms work?

## Intro to APIs

## Your tasks

 - **Street to Coordinates:** Figure out how to turn an arbitrary street address (find a place that is [sort of rainy](https://www.rainviewer.com/) right now to test with) into a latitude/longitude using the Geocoding API.
 - **Coordinates to weather:** Figure out how to turn a latitude/longitude pair into a weather forecast using the Dark Sky API Show the information displayed in the target:
    - Current Temperature
    - Current summaray
    - Outlooks for next sixy minutes, several hours, several days
 - **Street to Weather:** Put the above two together — given an arbitrary street address, display the forecast.

## Stretch goal
   
   - Stretch goal: check whether there is a >50% chance of precipitation at any point during the next 12 hours. If so, we will print "You should take an umbrella!"
   - Explore [the API documentation](https://darksky.net/dev/docs#forecast-request) to see what information is available to help you check this.
   - Something that might or might not be useful: [the `Time.at` method](https://apidock.com/ruby/Time/at/class).

        (Humans have [many, many different ways of representing dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_calendars). For the purposes of different pieces of software being able to agree on dates and times, most systems when talking to each other use [Epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) notation, or the number of seconds that have passed since midnight UTC on January 1st (minus leap seconds). Dark Sky, for example, includes times in this format. You can use `Time.at()` to convert to something more familiar, if you want to.)
 - Put all of the pieces together; given an arbitrary address:
    - print the current temperature
    - print outlook for the next hour
    - print whether a person should carry an umbrella.

## Using gems to interact with APIs

Interacting with APIs can be easier if someone has written a Ruby library (or "gem") with methods that already know the URLs, parse the JSON, and return exactly the values we want.

### Google Cloud Translate

See [this Chapter for a guide to using the Google Translate API via its first-party gem](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/849).

### Twilio

See [this Chapter for a guide to sending text messages via the Twilio API](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/848#example-of-how-to-send-an-sms-with-the-twilio-gem).

### Stretch goal

**Make your app behave like the target!** Accept some text from the user, ask for a target language, translate the text, and SMS it to a phone number.
